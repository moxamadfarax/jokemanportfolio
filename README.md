Mohamed's Portfolio


This was an assignment that really pushed me outside of my comfort zone. 
There were  still some issues I had, which is pretty evident if you view the project, but I'm quite proud of it.
My motivation was good grades.
I built this project as a introduction to building websites from the ground up.
